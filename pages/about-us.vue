      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        Influenced by the mythical, colorful transformation of nature’s favorite
        child Chinar leaves, and engineered only after thorough research,
        Bounipun has its roots deeply entwined in the intricate elements of
        Kashmiri heritage. Bounipun offers masterpieces that are beyond the
        conventional Kashmiri craft. It is essentially wearable art, embracing
        minimalism blended with eccentricity as its principle. The collection
        speaks its own language originated from the fables hidden in the
        historically rich avenues of Kashmir. Bounipun is a specialist luxury
        division bringing you a timeless craft from the Himalayan glacial
        Kashmir valley to your wardrobes. Created with a blend of traditional
        and innovative techniques, the wraps by Bounipun showcase the
        contemporary designs narrating splendid tales that unfold on the fervent
        paths of Kashmir. With every step you take on this edge of Kashmir, the
        streets embosom you deep into the golden days of the valley. The paths
        of downtown Kashmir are where the craft was born and nurtured, and you
        can sense it in every breath you take standing in the middle of the
        Valley.

        The premium Cashmere for Bounipun’s collection is hand-woven on vintage
        looms that date back 500 years. This delicate fabric is then treated by
        the purity of the Himalayan glacial water running down the mountains of
        Kashmir, preserving the softness and longevity that this fabric is known
        for. The local artisans of the valley carefully hand weave the fabric
        for Bounipun’s finest collections, shielding the true aura of Cashmere.
        The premium Cashmere used to engineer the timeless craft of this luxury
        brand are derived from the Pashmina goats found in the northern region
        of the country. The Bounipun shawls and scarves, however, take you on a
        journey that goes beyond the fabric and captures the unvarnished spirit
        of Kashmir. The detailed prints, emotion-reflective colors, and
        signature embroideries made of well-dissected thread bring forth the
        divine fusion of Kashmir’s hues, ethnicity, and folklore. These
        artistic, unexplored gems created by the young and experienced artisans
        don’t need an occasion to be worn.
