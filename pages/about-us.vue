            simplicity of silhouette. He was awarded as the “best debut” and
            “neo-minimal designer” by ELLE magazine just after the launch of his men’s

            And now, after winning laurels outside, he couldn’t resist going back to
            his roots, his own Kasheer, with plans to not only showcase the exotic
            Kashmiri craft using traditional but as well as ultra-modern methods to
            create some of the world’s finest wearable art CRAFTED IN KASHMIR that
            literally has no peer.<br /><br>

            craftsmen and talented local youth. The vision is to uplift the local
            craft by creating synthesis of folklore, ethnicity, hues and tints, most
            importantly signature design that is omnipresent in KASHMIR.
